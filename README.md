The landing page.

## Stacks

- [React](https://yarn.pm/react)
- [React DOM](https://yarn.pm/react-dom)
- [Next.js](https://yarn.pm/next)
- [Prettier](https://yarn.pm/prettier)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Development

To prevent conflict in module resolution, make sure to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
so `yarn.lock` won't conflict with `package-lock.json`.

- Clone repo: `git clone git@gitlab.com:koalafy/landing-page.git`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Start development server: `yarn dev`

And using stable Node.js version is highly recommended.

## Production

This site should be deployed as static website, in order to generate is as
a static website, run this following command:

```bash
yarn export
```

If `.next` directory is not exists, you need to build it first:

```bash
yarn build
```

The build (generated) directory will lives with name `out`. We can deploy it to PaaS like
Netlify & Zeit Now or to our own infra.
