Single Page Application (or SPA for short) is suitable for back-office app like internal dashboard. If you need an application used to administer operations that are not related to any direct sales effort, SPA is for you.

In addition, SPA is suitable for application that doesn't need any SEO optimization since all rendering are happen (and controlled) on client-side. SPA helps to decrease sensitive information leak, expensive server-side template rendering, and making web application simpler.

Basically SPA service we offer are same with our service on building a PWA. Except, there is no installable principle like what PWA does.

Technologies we use for building PWA are:

- Webpack for module bundler
- React, Vue and Svelte for base UI Library/Framework

And as always, if you have any custom needs, just let us know!
