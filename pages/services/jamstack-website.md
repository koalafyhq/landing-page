JAMStack websites are suitable for company profile, marketing page, microsite, blog, and anything
that have no frequent minor change but need "dynamic functionality" such as form handling,
ticketing system, checkout form, etc.

Advantages of JAMStack website are:

- Fast. Since there is no server-side job like template rendering & parsing, and also pages are cached on the edge
- Secure. Because there is no database. Just static document
- Reliable. Your website will always online because there is no need server runtime. Say goodbye to 503 Services Unavailable

The main difference of JAMStack website with general statically generated was: Content Management System. You (and your team)
no need to learn anything new regarding your current workflow on how you're going to publish a content, it just works as usual.

We currently provide Wordpress & Ghost as the backend services, but you can always bring up your own.

Technologies we're using for building JAMStack website are:

- Webpack for module bundler
- React, Vue and Svelte for base UI Library/Framework
- Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby, and Sapper for extended framework
- GraphQL for Data Fetching layer
- Wordpress & Ghost for the backend (CMS)
