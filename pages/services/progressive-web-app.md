Progressive Web App (or PWA for short) is **a set of principles** of build a **capable**; **reliable**,
and **installable** web application. This is suitable for application that has complex interaction,
functionality, and rich features.

These are examples that suitable to build a web application with PWA principles:

- Point of Sale (POS) system
- General Dashboard
- Stock/Money Exchange
- Media (Music, Image, Video) editor
- 3D Modeling
- Store-front application
- Etc (just tell us!)

By building a progressive web app, your app is more **capable** (the performance is beating native-like application),
**reliable** (reduce suffering with network condition, even your app can work offline if you want to!), and
**installable** (why use bookmark when your user can save your web app on their phone?).

Technologies we use for building PWA are:

- Webpack for module bundler
- React, Vue and Svelte for base UI Library/Framework
- C, C++, Rust, and Go for WebAssembly

And as always, if you have any custom needs, just let us know!
