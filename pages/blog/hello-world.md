As this post is published, we'll start to writing about what we learn; research, discover, and release. Our main topics
will covering about Web Development, Web Performance, System Administration, and some lower-level language
like C, C++, Go, and Rust.

Basically our main tech stacks are:

- JavaScript
- Go
- Rust
- Elixir
- C
- HAProxy
- Varnish
- Docker
- Redis
- Postgresql

So probably we'll talk about it too. We also have interest on particular _bleeding-edge_
technologies like:

- Edge Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Serverless Computing
- Container Technologies

And will share what learn about that here.

Currently we don't have any Newsletter subscription services (and have no plan to support it)
because we won't collect your email address. But you can subscribe to our [RSS Feed](/blog/rss)
instead.

We just getting started, so here is some typical hello world program written in
not-so-typical programming language choice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
