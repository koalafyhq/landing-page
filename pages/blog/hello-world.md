As this post published, we'll start to write about our research and what we've learned; discovered and released. Our main topics
will cover about Web Development, Web Performance, System Administration, and some lower-level language
like C, C++, Go, and Rust.

Basically our main tech stacks are:

- JavaScript
- Go
- Rust
- Elixir
- C
- HAProxy
- Varnish
- Docker
- Redis
- Postgresql

So probably we'll talk about them as well. We also have interest on particular _bleeding-edge_
technologies such as:

- Edge Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Serverless Computing
- Container Technologies

And we will share what've learned about those technologies here.

Currently we don't have any Newsletter Subscription service (and have no plan to support it)
because we won't collect your email address. But you can subscribe to our [RSS Feed](/blog/rss)
instead.

We just getting started, so here is some typical hello world program written in
not-so-typical programming language choice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
